Our team at Tax Auto has combined the latest advances in Machine Learning with the sophistication of Software Engineering to revolutionize the way we approach taxes. Now by just sending a picture of your receipt, our software analyzes the text to determine what type of purchase it is and consults current legislative rules to gradually file your taxes. Come time to submit, you can rest assured your taxes have been calculated with the click of a button.

Due to the time-constraints of the hackathon, we didnâ€™t get to each feature we wanted to develop. In the future, we plan on making this software more accessible through an app on both the App Store and Google Play in addition to the website while also enhancing the UI/UX. Once this is done, our team plans to launch tutorials for the website and how to file your taxes for younglings preparing for the real world.
